# Dashboard design layout

This is a responsive layout for an admin-dashboard style application

## Why?

I created this going through the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course. As one part of their Intermediate HTML and CSS section you learn to use grid. This project is my attempt at showcasing grid as well as some other HTML and CSS concepts.
